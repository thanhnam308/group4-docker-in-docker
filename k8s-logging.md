# Kubernetes logging

__Kubernetes logging__ is a mechanism that __helps you understand what is happening inside your application__.

The logs are particularly useful for debugging problems and monitoring cluster activity. Most modern applications have some kind of logging mechanism, and container engines are designed to support logging.

## Cluster-level logging

In a cluster, logs should have a separate storage and lifecycle independent of nodes, pods, or containers. This concept is called __cluster-level logging__. Cluster-level logging architectures require a separate backend to store, analyze, and query logs. Kubernetes does not provide a native storage solution for log data. Instead, there are many logging solutions that integrate with Kubernetes (CloudWatch).

# Commands

```bash
kubectl logs â€“f pods-name
```

Get logs of a specific container:
```bash
kubectl logs pod-name container-name
```

Get logs from a set of Pods with given label:
